**Program Status**
This program hasn't been tested much. It actually hasn't been tested since 2023. However, it does work. But I probably need to make some changes so it is easier to use.
Maybe someday, it can be a python package!


**Program Overview:**

This Python program utilizes [Herbie](https://github.com/blaylockbk/Herbie) to automate the download and extraction of meteorological model data. The process involves two main steps:

**Downloading Data:**

The program uses Herbie to fetch meteorological model data from online sources.
It downloads data for specific model levels and variables that are of interest.

**Extracting Data:**

After downloading, the program processes the data to extract the relevant information.
It focuses on the specific model levels and variables you are interested in, making the data ready for analysis.
