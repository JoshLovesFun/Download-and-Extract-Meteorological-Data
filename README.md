**Program Status:**

This program hasn't been extensively tested and hasn't been tested since 2023. However, it does work. I may need to make some changes to improve usability. Perhaps, in the future, it could be developed into a Python package!

**Program Overview:**

This Python program utilizes [Herbie](https://github.com/blaylockbk/Herbie) to automate the download and extraction of meteorological model data. The process involves two main steps:

1. **Downloading Data:**
   - The program uses Herbie to fetch meteorological model data from online sources.
   - It downloads data for specific model levels and variables that are of interest.

2. **Extracting Data:**
   - After downloading, the program processes the data to extract the relevant information.
   - It focuses on the specific model levels and variables you are interested in, making the data ready for analysis.
